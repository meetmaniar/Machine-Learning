This is the project of Data Mining.

We have implemented three Algorithms in R and Java:
1) Apriori Algorithm with arules package in R.
2) EClat Algorithm with arules package and from scratch in R.
3) EClat Algorithm designed from scratch, to test the efficiency of R.
4) FpGrowth Algorithm with Apache Spark API (SparkR, Version = 2.2.0 & hadoop_version = 2.7) 
   and the same algortihm in Java.

The dataset is of grocery store.
